# Ninjin Entities-Unofficial

An entities mod for DBC 1.4.78.

This mod was created by (Hedaox). This is a simple but very complete mod that add hundreds of new NPCs in the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.
Special thanks to FinTheHuman and JakeTheDog, without whom the Movie saga would not have come out.

The NPCs use the DBC AI meaning that they can fly and use Ki Attack. Each entity has his own set of ki attacks with different colors. Also some of them have an aura ! Can be normal, lightning or god. Also some of the NPCs are "trainers", this mean that they won't kill you if they beat you, instead they will put you into a KO state. 

You can use the "/summonninjin ninjinentities.\<EntityName\>" to summon the NPCs. Use "TAB" to auto complete the command.
